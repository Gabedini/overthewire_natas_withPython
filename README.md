# overthewire_natas_withPython
These Python scripts will be getting updated as myself and others from my team work through these challenges. The goal of the challenges largely is for us to learn Python more effectively. None of those working on this are Python programmers, simply technical people looking to get to a level where we can efficiently use/read Python when applicable.

[W3 Schools Python Tutorials](https://www.w3schools.com/python/) are all that is needed to do these solutions. In actuality, the W3 lessons go much further than needed, only about the first 15 are needed to be relatively effective at this sort of challenge.

[John Hammond](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1H1sBF1VAKWM3wMCn6H5Ql6OrgIivt2V) has a series of videos doing the Natas challenges with Python (this is from whom we got the idea), that can be referenced if stuck. Otherwise I will post solutions here. I would caution against simply viewing solutions, with perhaps the exception of when you are certain it is only a syntax error. Worth noting, he is using an older version of Python and some of his syntax has not worked for me, that could just be the way it's getting compiled. Python 3 will be the emphasis here because macOS.
