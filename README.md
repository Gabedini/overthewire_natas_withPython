# overthewire_natas_withPython
Just learning some github stuff is why I'm putting this up

Followed the John Hammond videos on Youtube for these, some edits are my own, some aren't
commented as best as I could do include thoughts while doing it instead of just solutions, prior to this I had 0 python experience which will be obvious
